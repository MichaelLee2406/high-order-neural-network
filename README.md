This study examines the failure prediction of a machine in a complicated context. External factors typically cause machine performance to diminish over time. A dynamic learning policy is required to adjust parameters depending on new data. In machine learning, this can refer to algorithms that learn from streaming data and alter their predictions accordingly. The artificial intelligence-based High-Order Neural Network (HONN) model is used as an intelligent method to imitate the stochastic environment's complex dynamic behavior. The proposed methodologies improve accuracy and efficiency in predicting when a machine may break. The performance difference between the offered algorithms indicates that the error does not exceed the required limit (<1%). This suggests that the analytical and numerical solutions can be utilized interchangeably in reality. Finally, all validation tests indicate that the proposed decision support system can assist policymakers in controlling stochastic prediction with low effort and implementing error-minimization strategies.
